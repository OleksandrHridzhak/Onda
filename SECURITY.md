## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of Onda seriously. If you find a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** This exposes the vulnerability to everyone.
2. Use the **[GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/OleksandrHridzhak/Onda/security/advisories/new)** feature.
3. Alternatively, contact me directly via the email associated with my GitHub profile.

### What to expect

* **Response:** I will acknowledge your report within **48–72 hours**.
* **Fix:** I will provide regular updates until the issue is resolved.
* **Credit:** You will be credited in the release notes once the patch is public (if you wish).
